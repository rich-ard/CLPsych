Examining Sentiment and Depression in Survivors of Intimate Partner Violence: Scripting and transformation to support analysis 

__________

Thanks for coming to review or expand upon the analysis we performed on interview transcriptions in support of work presented at the [Computational Linguistics and Clinical Psychology](http://clpsych.org) 2017 workshop.

Our text analysis work was done in R, using the [tm](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tm/index.html) text-mining package, and the [Syuzhet](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/syuzhet/index.html) sentiment analysis package. The two scripts "Sentiment Analysis.R" and "Top Ten Words.R" show the basic extraction work that was done to the interview transcriptions.

Statistical analysis was performed in SAS; visualization was assisted by the Python library [Seaborn](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn/).

Pull requests and suggestions are welcomed - please let us know if you should use any of this code, which is released here under an MIT license, in your own work!
